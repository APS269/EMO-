EMO - Emotional Analyzer
Overview
EMO is a web-based application designed to analyze the emotional content of text inputs. It uses machine learning techniques to predict the emotion conveyed in the input text. The application supports both English and Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English) text inputs.

Features
Emotion Analysis: EMO can predict the emotion conveyed in the input text, including emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
Language Support: Supports both English and Hinglish text inputs, providing flexibility for users.
Interactive User Interface: The web interface allows users to input text and receive real-time emotion analysis results.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier trained on a dataset of text inputs labeled with emotions.
Easy Deployment: The application can be easily deployed on any web server supporting Python and Flask.
How It Works
Input Text: Users enter text into the provided text area on the web interface.
Emotion Prediction: The input text is analyzed using a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the underlying emotion.
Display Results: The predicted emotion is displayed to the user in real-time on the web interface.
